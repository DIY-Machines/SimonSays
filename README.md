# SimonSays
a 3d printable game of Simon Says

Print, assemble and program your own Simon Says game. How much of the randomly generated colour pattern can you memorise and repeat back? Not sure, then why not make one and find out. (My current best is level 14).   ðŸ‘‡ More info below ðŸ‘‡

With an Arduino Nano at its core this project also incorporates an OLED screen, passive buzzer and some big bright buttons.
